# Kolakoski Sequence

This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of the Kolakoski sequence, including its generation algorithms and performance comparisons. It contains Python implementations of both a basic extension-based method and Nilsson’s more optimized algorithm, along with an enhanced method using lookup tables to improve computation efficiency. Additionally, you will find an analysis of the sequence's mathematical properties and potential areas for future research.

## Repository Contents

- **Kolakoski Sequence.pdf**: A detailed paper explaining the Kolakoski sequence, its history, mathematical properties, and various methods of generation.
